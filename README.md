Quick 'n' dirty Firefox extension to handle window decorator things. Made for fxOpera on Linux, but may work on other themes and platforms.

Here's what all I did:
* Turned off window decorations
* Moved menu bar to the bottom of the toolbars
* Added resizers around the border of the window (this is usually handled by the window decorator)
* Added window control buttons to the tab bar (these are in the title bar when the window is decorated, or in the navbar when in fullscreen)
* Perma-hid the default window control buttons that appear in fullscreen
* Rounded upper right corner when not maximized
* Rounded upper left corner when tabs are overflowing and window is not maximized
* Changed the window control buttons to resemble Chromium's Linux window control buttons
* Changed the maximize/restore window control button functionality to actually maximize/restore
* Added a 2px wide border to the sides of the window when not maiximized or fullscreen
* Made bottom-right corner resizer visible
